DIAGRAMKIT v2

The image files in this kit are for the creation of large, high-quality chess diagrams. Three board backgrounds and 72 figurine pieces (in 12 colours) are included, as well as six templates of the game array for use with any of the boards.

To make a diagram, you'll need a graphics editor such as Paint.NET (not MS Paint!) that can handle the figurines' png file format, which allows for transparency. Follow these steps to set up a position using Paint.NET (freeware available from www.getpaint.net):

1. Open a board image and the required figurines in Paint.NET. You can open multiple figurines simultaneously by selecting them in Windows Explorer and dragging the selection to the Paint.NET window.
2. The opened figurines are displayed as thumbnails in an Image List. Click on a figurine from this List, select the whole image (Ctrl-A), and copy it (Ctrl-C).
3. Switch to the board on the Image List and paste the figurine. The first time you do this, you have to "paste in to a new layer" (choose from Edit menu) to keep the figurine's background transparent. For subsequent inserts, however, a normal paste (Ctrl-V) is sufficient (because the pieces will go on the newly created layer, which is active - see note below). 
4. Drag the figurine to the appropriate square. When the piece is released, a border appears around it that matches the size of a square, allowing you to centre the piece exactly within the square (adjust using the keyboard's arrow keys).
5. After inserting all of the pieces, resize the image if necessary and save it in your preferred format. 

Note that the multiple-layers feature of Paint.NET enables you to keep the figurines of a diagram as a separate layer from the board. That means you can, for example, copy only the figurines from an image and paste it on a different board. To do this, open the Layers Window (press F7), and highlight the figurine layer to work on it only. You can also untick the box for the board layer to make it invisible. Save a diagram image in the pdn format to preserve the layering. 

What's new in Version 2
* The figurine pieces are available in an additional six colours.
* The dark and light blue figurines have both been improved, making them more legible.
